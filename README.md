# Python experiment

This is the base HyperDev app, rewritten in Python using Flask

# Good to know

- requirements.txt holds your dependencies, they are installed with pip
- There is no automatic reinstallation yet: you have to make changes to
  package.json to force an install (I added a field to do so, just add something there and you'll force a reinstall!)
- If you only need to edit the source code, then it's ok! Just edit it 
  and it will work
